## Future Improvements

ContactPlanner is an evolving project, and here are some future improvements in the pipeline:

### Immediate Features to Work On

1. **Search with Enter Key**: Enable users to initiate a search by simply pressing the "Enter" key, offering a more intuitive search experience.

2. **Track Preview Samples**: Enhance the song listings by providing preview samples for each track, allowing users to preview songs before adding them to their playlists.

3. **Filter Existing Playlist Tracks**: Modify the search results to display only songs that are not already present in the user's playlist, helping to avoid duplicates in custom playlists.

4. **Loading Screen for Playlist Saving**: Implement a loading screen or progress indicator during the playlist saving process, offering a better user experience.

5. **Optimize Token Expiration Logic**: Refine the access token logic to expire at precisely the right time, instead of setting expiration from when the user initiates their next search, ensuring a more secure and reliable authorization process.

6. **Restore Search Term on Login Redirect**: When a user is redirected after login, maintain the search term from before the redirect, preserving the continuity of their search.

7. **Persistent Playlist Information**: Ensure that playlist information doesn't get cleared, even if a user has to refresh their access token. This guarantees a seamless playlist management experience.

8. **Fetch Existing Playlists**: Add functionality for users to fetch and view all their existing playlists, making it easier to manage and organize their music collection.

### Necessary Improvements:

- **Enhanced Authorization**: Implement more secure forms of authorization, such as a login portal or authorization code with PKCE flow. [Learn more](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow)
